## Introduction
As part of my portfolio, this web application was designed and implemented from scratch as a personal project

## Context
This is an evaluation web app initially designed for a computer science department of the University of Bambili, Cameroon.

Each registered teacher can set MCQ test which will be accessible by students at a particular time, scheduled by an algorithm. and after the the test paper time is passed, the teacher can get the students' results in a PDF file. and on the other side, students can download the correction
## Objectives
As specific objectives, I wanted to built a functionnal web application which would:

Provide suitable online area to our beloved lecturers, where they will be able to set and schedule test papers wherever they are and at the end of the set time, download the test report as pdf file format to finally send it to the school record office.

Provide a user-friendly personal area where our students will be able to write their exams online, and as soon as the test paper ending time reaches, download to its correction such as to learn from their mistakes

Provide a suitable notice area where students will get information about the activities undertaken by the departmental club, such as the schedule of extra classes, the maintenance day, requests from the department, etc.

To easily get in touch with our departmental â€˜staff as well as our delegates as soon as an issue occurs, one of our aim is to provide to the whole department, a very comfortable area each will be able to get their phone numbers, names and email addresses.
